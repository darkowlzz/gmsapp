{"name":"GMS Mobile App","tagline":"One place for all of Global Meditation Scope.","body":"### Why an app?\r\nBecause mobile apps are more intimate than websites. They are with the users all the time in their devices and understand them better. They exist in the same environment and situation as the user, hence they are able to serve the users better.\r\n\r\n### One GMS Directory\r\nThe mobile app serves as a directory for all the GMS hosts and meditations. Having a GMS directory offline and at a single place is pretty handy. Users are empowered with the ability to find the just right person to inspire and guide them. This directory would help people discover more inspiration. Overall, uniting the GMS soulfam üåç\r\n\r\n### What does the app do?\r\nThe app brings together all the data about the hosts and meditations, spices them up and gives the users powerful tools to easily access and consume the data. Some of the features are:\r\n* Most importantly, shows the meditation time as per the local time of the user. No more pain of time conversion üòá\r\n* Lists the meditations separated into various categories: breathe, move, listen, heal and create\r\n* Regularly updated data. Any change in data is instantly reflected in the app when connected to the Internet.\r\n* Text search to quickly search through the huge lists.\r\n* Easy access to Periscope and Twitter profile of the hosts.\r\n* Favorite meditation. Meditations can be favorited and moved to a separate list of favorite meditations. \r\n* Notification reminder of the favorite meditations, helping remind the user of the meditation even when offline and periscope notification failure due to no Internet access üòã\r\nThese are some of the useful features of the app. Many more are yet to come via updates.\r\n\r\n### Android App Demo\r\n[![Android app demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/w8ww9Y6_h_8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ww9Y6_h_8)\r\n\r\n### What about the iOS app?\r\niOS app is under development.
